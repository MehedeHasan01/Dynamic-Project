        <br>
        var: <br>
        ** Function-scoped: Variables declared with var are function-scoped, meaning they are limited in visibility to the function in which they are declared. If a variable is declared inside a block (like an if statement or a loop), it will still be accessible outside that block.
        <br>
        ** Hoisting: Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope. This means that they are moved to the top of the function or script during the compilation phase,
        <br>
        let: <br>
        ** Block-scoped: Variables declared with let have block scope. They are only accessible within the block (enclosed by curly braces) where they are defined.
        <br>
        ** No hoisting: Unlike var, variables declared with let are not hoisted to the top of their scope. They are only accessible after the point of declaration.
        <br>
        const:
        <br>
        ** Block-scoped: Like let, const is block-scoped and is only accessible within the block where it is defined.
        <br>
        ** Immutable: Variables declared with const are constant and cannot be reassigned after declaration. However, it's important to note that for objects and arrays declared with const, the contents (elements or properties) can still be modified.
